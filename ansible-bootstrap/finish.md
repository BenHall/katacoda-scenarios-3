# Summary

Let us summarize, what we have achieved so far:
> We have prepared the successful connection from an Ansible system to a target system by
> 1. installing an ssh server on the target
> 2. creating an SSH key pair on the Ansible system
> 3. copying the public key of the Ansible host to the target system
>
> We have tested the connection by using an Ansible "ping", which is an SSH connection from the Ansible host to the target, actually.
